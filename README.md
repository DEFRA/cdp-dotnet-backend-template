### MongoDB

#### MongoDB via Docker

See above.

```
docker compose up -d mongodb
```

#### MongoDB locally

Alternatively install MongoDB locally:

- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/#installation) on your local machine
- Start MongoDB:

```

#### MongoDB in CDP environments

In CDP environments a MongoDB instance is already set up
and the credentials exposed as enviromment variables.


### Inspect MongoDB

To inspect the Database and Collections locally:

mongosh
```

You can use the CDP Terminal to access the environments' MongoDB.

### Testing

Run the tests with:

Tests run by running a full `WebApplication` backed by [Ephemeral MongoDB](https://github.com/asimmon/ephemeral-mongo).
Tests do not use mocking of any sort and read and write from the in-memory database.

```bash
dotnet test
````

### Running

```bash
dotnet run --project Backend.Api --launch-profile Development
```
